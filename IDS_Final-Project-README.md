## Abstract
The Global Terrorism Database (GTD) is an open-source database containing details on terrorist acts that occurred worldwide between 1970 and 2017. The database has over 180,000 attacks and provides systematic data on both domestic and foreign terrorist incidents that took place over this time. 

In this project, we explore the terrorism dataset using interactive data visualizations with the aim of uncovering insights and using data science to provide solutions to potentially identified opportunities.

Through this project, we have found many key insights such as identifying an increase in terrorism incidents, a shift in attack concentration from Western countries to those in Europe and Asia, when attacks have historically occurred, and if terrorist attacks are fueled by political grievance.

Our project has enabled us to discover new insights into the Global Terrorism Database. Our interactive data visualizations can potentially help researchers and policymakers better understand terrorism and develop effective strategies to combat it. This dashboard can also act as a good educational tool for the general population who is interested in learning more about the history of global terrorism.

## Running Instructions
To run our application, please access [our deployed site](https://cmu-ids-spring-2023-ids-final-terrorism-streamlit-e0r4li.streamlit.app/). This site can also be accessed using the Online URL linked above. 

If you run into any issues with the deployed site, please contact bw2@andrew.cmu.edu or another member of our team as the site may need to be occasionally rebooted.

### Asking interesting questions
Given the seriousness surrounding this type of data, we wanted to make sure to ask questions that could potentially benefit future researchers or even policymakers. As such, we aimed to answer the following questions:
1. What countries have experienced the most terrorist attacks?
2. What kinds of weapons were used in these attacks?
3. How do these assaults vary by year?
4. What groups are involved in these attacks?
5. What kinds of targets are involved?
6. When do these attacks occur?

### Sketching
After realizing these questions, we sought to explore a variety of different types of data visualizations to best portray our data. We created a variety of different sketches and came up with an overall plan for the dashboard. 

### Data cleaning and EDA
After careful data inspection and exploration, we cleaned the data to remove any unwanted features, clean up any data inconsistencies and treatment of all null values. Additionally, we made sure to remove any duplicate values, of which we found none.

### Coding: Checkpoint
With a solid idea for our dashboard from the sketches we created as well as the EDA we performed, we created three different tabs that would focus on telling different aspects of the story. We developed the world map visualization to depict the state of terrorism around the world over the past 50 years; designed interactive bar charts that would show the connection between different terrorist groups and target, attack, and weapon type and explored trends using timeseries visualizations to showcase when these attacks have occurred.

### Coding: Final
Building on our ideas from the checkpoint, we made sure to really hone the story that we wanted to tell to the user. We made sure to write up brief introductions to explain the importance and relevancy of the visualizations, user instructions/suggestions to help guide the user, and insights that would prompt the user to think deeper about the data presented to them. Additionally, we made sure to include plenty of more useful visualizations to reveal more insights to our data. We also found it necessary to reorganize some visualizations between the three different tabs of our dashboard to provide a more seamless experience for the user.
